📺 Marketing ROI Dashboard: TV Commercials, Digital Campaigns & Advertising Performance
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to track marketing spend, revenue generation, and return on investment (ROI) across TV commercials, digital channels, and traditional campaigns—empowering marketing teams and executives to optimize advertising strategies and budget allocation.
